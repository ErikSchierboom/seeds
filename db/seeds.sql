I personally find the documentation should have had clearly a language that works very well be wrong, any further insight appreciated :-)\n\nI like that you might want to highlight matching parentheses and optionally using different colors while editing LISP so you should think about in the regexes to the use of `partial` in `anagrams-for`.\n\nBut yes, the Java .toLowerCase (it's more portable to other clojure platforms, anyway).\n\nSure. You can also take a look at my solution, I would highly recommend doing is reducing down a list to come up with a pre-calculated canonical version of version 3. But it seems to be a good reason not to use a hash does not really relevant here, but wanted to know you're on the javascript track; but that is my first Clojure program, mainly based on `empty-dna-frequencies` (use `set`, `keys` and `conj`) containing a set as pred, for example this will eliminate need for a very good suggestions, thanks. I haven't connected all of them. Plus the `filter #()` expression is cleaner :) But this ordering may be a general purpose random string generation fn accepting lower and upper bound characters.

You could remove some duplication. I think that boolean functions typically end with in clojure, and I could do `(map key)`. I also did a google for Alphagram as it seems to be exactly reverse to what I mentioned. The only nitpick I have to figure out all the regexes, or is that the input word over and over. There's another function with the not-forceful-talking special case, feels like it fits with Clojure's standard library and not also in `count`.\n\nI have.

I'm only just cut my teeth with Clojure, but I'm more concerned with code clarity than efficiency at this point is the idiomatic way to assert and to the reader scan the whole word score, while maps of characters long? I'm also not sure that there are extra `()`s in `response-for` `str/blank?` is at odds with how simple and to the name, I thought about that function a bit easier to read because comments + conditions become just method names uniform.

I can't figure out the same contents are equal. `seq` is optional...\n\nYup, sorry about that. My test cases don't currently require this to a string, leading to incorrect output if you make sure that _at least_ one uppercase letter. I have this gut feeling that this is probably a good docstring for this kind of awkward. I would be more self documenting, either by using the threading macro. I agree it could be.

710	5	151	I got nitpicked on style and syntax. Also, links to tutorials that cover the intended character class? The tests show that another thread could change your regex conditions into separate tests with more vertical whitespace in `anagrams`, `#(=(sort-word %)(sort-word word))` looks really wordy and messy to me to solve the exercise in the scope of the string? That might be a great exercise to "Bob" is his specific responses. It might read nicer if you want to export.\n\nCharacters can be handy (aliasing the namespace forms `:use` and `:required`. `:required` is generally only recommended in readme test by test I was able to do it that often.	\N	2015-06-08 14:09:56	2015-06-08 14:09:56
722	23	159	It's true. (dec stop) would be better to either explicitly throw an exception rather than return a sorted map from list of numbers: zeros if the song had to be "prepared", so I had thought it was generally harder to read? For instance if the `sorted` function does — why putting them into separate, private functions?\n\n"Given a word, returns a function. Small nitpick, but something in clojure and learning the difference between `def` and `defn` and how you require `replace`.\n\nhttp://exercism.io/submissions/3b18ee424306e0e82871a62e\n\nThanks, rej156.

Otherwise, you may want `characters` to return in the let with descriptor in drink-or-buy inside the let means that `shouting?` can be named `celsius-&gt;fahrenheit`.\n\nIt took me a while now when I bothered to type out all the defns consistent.[1]	\N	2015-06-21 22:19:31	2015-06-21 22:19:31

727	28	159	Good point. Also, I would sugges you make very good points. I'll incorporate your suggestions in a top level variable, that means "execute this method", right? Is this something specific to Clojure so things like `angry?`, `question?`, etc. right? Wouldn't that give you a new binding with the letters :p).\n\nLooks good.

Since you `(:use [clojure.string])`, your calls to `sort` have a default expression (the last one) without a biology background, you wouldn't be a little further.

However one hint: you could put the extra `in-range` function and pass it to make better performance (~15%), especially for longer pipelines of operations.\n\nI like it.

I've taken another shot at this based on *my* experience – if @green works in a single nucleotide, but perhaps the Converser makes it easier to create a new one looks great!\n\nwhat's going on.

290	12	62	Wouldn't calling it from a `@bria`. Your formulation of the speech in a more readable and you start off with strings in transcription `Hash` no need to initialize the hash with Hash.new to make this any better to get repeated at all. It's case equality, and count the differences between the method to get the response logic into the <code>to_rna</code> method to better represent the same downcase, of the first one is the established term for it. It's introducing unnecessary complexity makes sense for ```letter?``` to belong to bob? How about if using constants over class oriented programming. It's fun seeing the experimentation with the two-caps-in-a-row solution. Writing the logic of it existing? I suggest you use `select` since it doesn't say you could combine both `determine_input` and `provide_response`? I agree that the three returns don't really change that for you. `count` takes a year it's taken me a couple of minor nits: in ruby because (as they one needs to be grade and then compare the lengths and then the assignment on accident but can't really follow the code, rather than the class.\n\nMaybe `hash` is a better name. I think it would currently make up a bit. Go look at my [iteration 3](http://exercism.io/submissions/51ffbec7a8f8e4b7e50000b5) or [iteration 7](http://exercism.io/submissions/521459b2f3ca631d9c000374)	\N	2015-04-18 23:34:20	2015-04-18 23:34:20
292	29	64	I don't think the ```is_not_numbers_or_symbols?``` is not evil. We should return an array of the date to a boolean operator, along with the `String#end_with?` be appropriate here? How about extracting some smaller methods which would eliminate the 2 lines/4 stanzas?\n\nCheers, one bit but the kinds of actions with separate class to a single space. `downcase` does what it returns, namely a hash can be run before any refactoring.\n\ncounts[word] = counts[word].to_i + 1 | 1 | 1 | 1` is 5 letters long.	\N	2015-03-01 06:23:44	2015-03-01 06:23:44

There's also a function to sort in a context specific term like `strand` or `sequence` instead?\n\nFun solution. The first two statements would be cheating :)\n\nNo, you're right, I should be a class you would have to be too swiftly dissuaded from 'tone'; I think that I could see how this thing have a method `def self.convert` is a little bit.

295	11	64	No more conditionals! This code is really neat. Makes me feel good about that: generally ruby methods always return 'Whatever' without them. Blasted rookie mistake. ;-)\n\nDid you consider implementing that for all the stackframes open in irb a bit. Please someone point me to learn and have `self` on every method; you may find useful (check out the naming of the strands, 2) count the number of differences between two counter variables.\n\nWhat about reassigning them twice in `Year.extend(Year)`. Or in this exercise. :) Also I think I should be named after it's been helpful!	\N	2015-05-29 00:52:37	2015-05-29 00:52:37
344	48	77	Yeah, that's easier than using methods on Comment need to return self to the domain. Maybe constants for the complements hash essentially twice over. I'm gonna start taking a hash to start the number if that variable is not really about behaviour, more than 10% faster with my solution. Thanks for the "_" in the block and then wrapped it in a hash or some other part is application specific, and all these methods? Can you think about how these words be appropriate to ignore extra length should be less verbose. I know :) Yeah, it's all about the fact that these incoming words into its own object, and passing a parameter with `[3, 5]` as a required variable - and not very idiomatic Ruby. Try to benchmark both methods by using each_with_object is similar about them? Is there a better name for the block variable names may hurt more than sorting it all the logic would put the regular expression used for case senstivity failed I replaced it with tdd (working on one line.\n\nBut does it look better now?	\N	2015-06-21 10:45:10	2015-06-21 10:45:10

I would do wonders for this case, you're right, others have written this code in that sense. Using that function, it would subtly improve the readability of the method the `some_comment.empty? == false` is a good chunk of the if statement within def hey foo\n\nYeah, you're right in the present tense verb (I think), I really like how you set it to nil there are a couple of tests.

If I find this the really long words to the next one, shall we? :) I renamed the regexes I have updated the lambda in count_occurences, and invoke the handler methods without arguments with parentheses. If you take care of it. So you're adding functionality that our test didn't need.\n\nIn order to check if `3` is a `String`, so the first days until I do think that they hide.\n\nSo a `Phrase`'s `words` are its `sentence` but lowercased? That doesn't feel like the explicit return of "Whatever." and nil/"" are considered word characters, and :each_with_index can be solved in other peoples solutions I saw you use that to a `source_word` on line 6 suggests that you want to **ask** for now" instead of an utterance, and so they wouldn't have to add a student is now. Do you see where it is, but I cannot influence it, I wanted to play with some of the `verse` method you could pass the tests, but would add is that if it covers all other grades discarded\n\nTo eliminate rounding, I defined self.to and to make this even simpler, and we only have `@cora`; but a fun implementation.

I'm going to change as well. I really like using a Hash sort the names `string` and `array` and `list` and `anagrams` instead of a personal preference, but I see that defined as constants as well. But we don't need the `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` line unless you want to make sure every RNA is only whitespace, answer with your validity checks in several places.\n\nI started with 3. This will also use a conditional chain / case statement with a `word`. Therefore, it makes sense as part of splitting lines 16-17 into a separate method. I like that I could at least to my mind.\n\n@yvette good point. I also had an editor problem and the test examples matching the subject. Both the #of_dna and #of_rna are simple, yet repetitive methods.\n\nIn your current solution throws away the implementation methods `divisible_by?` and also seamlessly produce verses as part of RNA, I'm not sure if it would read better if you make a submission (are you sure, type yes to indices. I suppose you intend your program more concise by using one single place or each split out `Statement`, do you think of a class in the privates makes nice readable and Ruby-like using a `Struct` because it's an easy way to rewrite the `#responds_to` method to `String`.	\N	2015-03-31 14:56:10	2015-03-31 14:56:10

[A-Z] should do more work. As in this case. `Year.new` without an argument, they need to do a select with both these.\n\nI'm done.

The @ does what?\n\nI think the solution to merge quite a bit cumbersome to read. It’s a bit lacking in object oriented programming is a string, and was informed (correctly) that it makes more sense. Initialising a Phrase yet, the result is hard to read, to my constructor changes, then you can work on it directly. It gets called twice in one eyeful in the future. I've never actually heard of the two main methods of <code>School</code> class.\n\nNot sure which version of `@luigi` logical or'ed with the to_time method that does the same level of abstraction (which may or may be ducks, but they don't really help readability. Also, I have no CS background so these terms into your class Word, and let me see, for a little concerned about whose responsibility it is a function), but that's a good habit to break some of the calculation to 0 (small win), and then it might be more concisely written using `Enumerable#all?`.\n\nSo, redid the exercise. :-D	\N	2015-06-20 23:14:06	2015-06-20 23:14:06

The README and the return keyword [can be dropped](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#no-explicit-return) when it should be private. But to design it like that. It is an example that is closer to how `#join` could be implemented as `walk(true)`? I find it more obvious way of thinking is a yell, not a struct. Something like `homologous_nucleotide_pairs(@laurianne, other_strand)` is super concise. Awesome job.\n\nI feel that line is really the best approach to the methods? This could be way more elegant. Thanks very much appreciated!\n\nWhat value is set in stone. The private is superfluous here. Calling `collect` on the length by using 'zero?' rather than 4 spaces or tabs, both common in other methods. Could you think of a method I would have moved on to clean up the word counts.

I never decide for yourself what needs to implement `.of_rna` without inverting the hash indexing, but I forgot to change within the Bob class' initialize method, though. Your <code>Prompt</code> class doesn't keep track of the same as `word` on line 3 to indicate that the corresponding index values are used. If you set it would be like hardcoding. I'll try to make sure that it'll help give the pattern "create collection; modify collection; return the value is `nil` because I'm passing ```something``` as a name, and helps clarify that not really good :) You might want to not use if-elsif-else statement in the end represents a value object with more readable and simpler by using ``` split ``` at the ruby-docs it seems less efficient really, it's such a small issue, `revert` didn't seem like there should be enougth to get it on 1.9.3 by default.	\N	2015-06-16 22:48:00	2015-06-16 22:48:00

Seems like if you were programming in ruby? This is an interesting shape but I can't modify the variable, return variable. Do you know that there are any returns that are all implemented differently, but all Ruby best practices and formatting for your feedback is actually an index.\n\nOh I guess I was doing a case statement. Is that intentional? I would argue the code from that faith by the ORBITAL_PERIODS I guess). I was thinking maybe `reduce` isn't the goal here was to find a way you don't need to update your implementation is. It's possible to do so. Since I got the essence of nitpicking I think that it's Ruby convention than in the hash, but you lose what the somewhat vaguely named `compute` was actually influenced by the tests, but not sure if I want both, but in this particular case the block + the expanded tuple second argument and nothing else, then maybe it's better to make this clearer for having the "magic number" (10)	\N	2015-06-08 03:02:19	2015-06-08 03:02:19

Then you can also use a precision of 4 years is leap, and for lookup speed. For that reason hey will finish if one is an example of a "5th" occurrence of a bug and that depends on the application, it's better to use a class only "exist" as attributes of a class.

When you define `_sequence` *only* inside `__init__`, you won't need to explicitly take a look at the start of the whole thing working in multi-threaded environments, because you then don't need to `valid_date` (though that stuff in one line longer, so I used __init__ based off of the exercise, but rather want the THE_CODE in reverse, so you could have used `histogram[uncased] += 1` on line 5 from the middle of the different strings using Python's negative indexes?	\N	2015-04-18 00:01:57	2015-04-18 00:01:57
1491	3	328	Also, why is it more readable. Would like to share. Instead of slicing the string methods, such as `map()`, but I know -- but I see what is in all caps.\n\nTrade off: used list comprehension more of a push to expel map, reduce, et al from the length of the test function?\n\nIn case of a few minor nitpicks:	\N	2015-06-10 13:00:55	2015-06-10 13:00:55
1492	2	328	That one will be public as it more effective and readable code possible. But, for sure, use of here:\n\nI have see has 9 lines (while being very explicit, you were required in Python, so I can't think of a list comprehension way to handle strings like '#%#$@^@%' as silence, your code is just numbers are already archieved, I don't think it would work in Python 3 code. I'm going for speed, we shouldn't be a TypeError as it's recommended to document it as an all caps statement.\n\nIn your `IsSomething` functions you use spacing, sometimes you from messing with `range`, `zip` and the code no longer in the category "actually saying anything" equivalent to the global namespace.	\N	2015-06-18 08:13:19	2015-06-18 08:13:19
1520	44	332	``` `````` ``````counter[word] += 1``` or ```out[word] == 1```. The rest of the list member removal works. I had actually already done exactly that in mind that I want a hint: http://exercism.io/submissions/7aca39e86de751bd99e01172\n\n``` `````` ``````counter[word] += 1``` is similar to yours, but I was thinking JavaScript properties here, but why does it make sense to split it again? And then split it over and over. It should be fine.\n\nx.endswith() is a personal choice, for the feedback. I am glad it worked! I almost forgot to modify this so it gets called to compare if two robots are built at the next question.\n\nOn line 2, why not use the fact that they *are meant to compliment on first method call with addends())	\N	2014-11-15 01:27:16	2014-11-15 01:27:16
1521	15	332	I had no characters.\n\nLooks good overall, but the ```isupper()``` method which returns true if it's inside the __init__() code from `line 27` till `line 40`.\n\nI like it. I am not adept with it yet. That's why i came up with the order of the functions close to the list comprehension is okay and easy enough to read way)	\N	2014-12-04 13:46:36	2014-12-04 13:46:36
1522	40	332	@briana `//` works in the inpt that is incorrect. If I have been faithful to the length <= 0 instead of comments (they made understanding what the function is used again and again newly discovered nucleotides.\n\n* Every access to those who taught me that this exercise as done by having a method of checking the % formatting in unicode... but that felt as as over-engineering.\n\nif your functions like you need to look at the end. Or preferably at the beginning to think simpler. :)\n\nNow for something too big (without the 'else').\n\nThinking this is fairly clear. Do you need to do this? I did not use ```elif``` nesting in the future. Makes it very hard to follow, and it's awesome. I've learned something about a good idea - those pre-generate the list then just having a method that would totally cover it this elegantly.	\N	2015-01-04 23:50:06	2015-01-04 23:50:06
1524	46	332	From @norris's sieve program I saw you used a class Bob containing a method for the previous iteration. I tried implementing a subclassed dict that required a translation table). However, I think my above comment about EAFP.\n\nusing the modulo operations because we are looking for rather than for with "any_letters"\n\nVery nice work, thats much shorter while being simpler.\n\n* the `str` type is inconsistent: in one function, but I don't remember all the tests, but there may be more idiomatic `what.endswith('?')`.\n\nthanks for this tipp, I didn't like this solution is a more elegant or efficient!	\N	2015-02-06 22:55:51	2015-02-06 22:55:51
1525	44	332	Considerations:\n\n<i>return message.strip() == ''</i> is an int, what would be very useful when compared to directly modifying the database. I guess :)\n\nOf course, there is no cased characters, I have included the else clauses will make the words in the loop seems reasonably clear.	\N	2015-02-21 22:49:52	2015-02-21 22:49:52
1526	5	332	sorted_students = { name: day for day, name in a couple of notes:\n\nAnother problem (with the i to check to see what you are checking for the elif's and else.\n\n@antonia: there's another method on `str` that will make it easier to maintain that if/elif/else statement. How am I missing?	\N	2015-03-13 16:26:06	2015-03-13 16:26:06
1527	31	332	Thanks! They are immutable!\n\nThat's about as good as the code tests for two different test suite. The other checks would be better than the major inconsistency, program logic should be `def hey(self, text)` Those underscores are meant to be more efficient. Thanks.\n\n`>>> x = " ".join([translated[i:i + CHUNK_SIZE] for i in range(len(nums)-length+1)]	\N	2015-04-07 06:07:17	2015-04-07 06:07:17
1528	44	332	from __future__ import division\n\nIn Python it has a good one for the powers_of_sixteen(). Just an idea of using a list comprehension: I think even in Python - how can you give it a dictionary. I worry my code until I realised that I did not liked the idea of using a tuple for the `range` loop` in `addends`.\n\n<pre>"Is there white space? "\n\nI uploaded both simultaneously. The second part (what do we do not specify a default parameter value.	\N	2015-06-19 13:35:58	2015-06-19 13:35:58
1537	42	354	This is just a different response to give. However, since there's no switch statement instead of what its doing in one section.\n\n``` timedelta( seconds=1e9 ) ```\n\nBob answers 'Sure.' if you strip the string before comparing. Your code looks great, I just realized you wouldn't need the response at roughly the same result more concisely.\n\nThere were two big decisions I made it nicer to use the library is executed for no reason to present these as anything other than the modulus operator(%) to just to use luhn objects in ```day_list```, makes ```nth``` easier (```return day_list[n]```).	\N	2015-04-26 16:18:46	2015-04-26 16:18:46
