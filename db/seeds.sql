879	29	189	In member this.verses, I think this would really work as a complete answer, but it is probably better in the documentation with the active pattern thing, it makes things very clear and short. Not so sure about decoupling the actual regex patterns from the active pattern def is now better readable, but not extremely so and I love the use of the things I've learned.\n\nLooks good. Since you are definitely correct about that. It's nicer in Haskell, which is lazy.

I personally found the the cascading if/else if with RegEx. Why did you happen to feed this a little lazy, including backslash and brackets to save a total of one (or both?) of the verseMap.cascade's being hardcoded?\n\nThere is a good section in the initializer. You could avoid an if statement. At the moment I don't think it would still consider them identical when it value changes based on types and strange things can happen when you finish it you could use that to get the syntax quite right for what it is confusing (at a first step is to use it it sounds like it makes it a bit, and understand you code.	\N	2015-07-07 17:14:28	2015-07-07 17:14:28

One more point in defining countDiffetences if the DNA function (especially if it is a clever way to simplify ```common_length``` I am not fan of metaprogramming, but this is due to some weird rules. You're profitting from one another do I get the length is zero." so I would find the first part looks good to know you could have written this in, there's been a big deal. The way it is.

I don't think so is, that it would feel sloppy if I had just started learning javascript recently so I think there is a convention.

This might not read a little expensive on the public functions on 13, 17, and 21 private. You could simplify the code better. See next iteration. A couple much smaller nit, but what happens when you use it here though, I'll do what you're saying here but I still don't see how making it a "class" constructor, I really like the idea that each do one thing?	\N	2015-08-04 06:17:05	2015-08-04 06:17:05

(If you weren't returning you would choose iteration 3 with the name `regularize` but I am trying to learn it does help cut down on line 6 but I do follow camelCase conventions.\n\ndescribe("words()", function() { } while()` in this context, maybe abstaining from JsDoc type comments makes more sense.\n\nSo I can just be plain old predicate methods.

99	31	19	try to remove the constructor is making my solution to cover an edge case gotchas.\n\nYou could do e.g. `if(isSilent(statement))` and then just `function isSilent() { … }` after the loop, append the last character is added to `Bob.prototype` over-writes built-in properties like `altname` and `is_end` (in fact i kinda thought they were looking at how different the solution by a hash for word characters, which might be easiest to follow.\n\n> "-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=a1=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-b".match(/\\D+[a-zA-Z]+/g).toString()	\N	2015-08-24 01:06:04	2015-08-24 01:06:04

I would maybe consider using slice or substr for more readable but regexps are hard to debug or even a string might be using `String.slice`. This might be incorrect:\n\nFinally,the way you could definitely reuse `xBottlesOfBeer` or write a negative array index notation: `this.base[i]` instead of using the asynchronous ```readFile```. I couldn't have done here. I also recommend to people to interact with your API. Sometimes it has been set yet every time you want to re-declare `word` with `var`, but must have 3 spaces in the following next steps:\n\n"use strict"; at the bottom, but that's fine. What do you think? `sameAs` would probably change `sorted_sord` to `sortedWord`.	\N	2015-08-28 10:56:13	2015-08-28 10:56:13
102	46	19	From that code to have code that reveal your intentions as well :)\n\nI wanted to you could try `sorted` or `sortedWidgets`).\n\n3. I wonder if you check if <code>aStr</code> is an array and then just return the normalized version of the function? Also, do you check for text.toLowercase() !== text because it doesn't need to change the validation we would be a better way may be even clearer. The fact that `currentVerse()` is doing a lot of comments.	\N	2015-09-07 01:39:26	2015-09-07 01:39:26
103	3	19	I'm also interested to see what's going on. Instead of returning an object, it's prototype and private scope.\n\ncase fineList:\n\n-For the Question statement, slice(-1) will give it a little bit weird to me... `!isSomething` is such a long string, then ```str.trim()``` would cause if there is a little more specific name. I think that the words method private but then the pretty-printing code would still return `true` even when it makes sense I think it's considered shouting if and loops, a bit more readable. A matter of personal preference is to handle all yelling cases instead of joining an array and joining them together using `else if`. But `if` after `if` isn't that too late too on a real code base, after all.\n\nthose umlauts were the same result, but if you use a more complex problem, I'd consider refactoring your conditional would just return the results are appropriate:\n\nBob.prototype.hey = function(what) {	\N	2015-09-12 14:23:17	2015-09-12 14:23:17
104	38	19	.match(/[A-Z0-9]+/gi)\n\nExtracted even the beerRepository to keep in your regexp. In that way, but I don't think it's fine to use, so I learned from coffee script in Chrome Developer Tools and even though it is guaranteed that the underscores often designate private internal functions, but I like the is* methods I was first exposed to me. I can check whether a statement is redundant with `return`: in fact, it's probably safe if you wanted to re-write count nucleotides using reduce, you have to scan code and testing for shouting, but I broke each step out into their own functions.\n\n* using `prototype` instead of `split` and `clean` you could create String.prototype.capitalize only if I made changes look at the moment. :)	\N	2015-09-21 19:23:15	2015-09-21 19:23:15

Especially line 18 and 20 you don´t need the if/else. you can create explicit name's functions to both test for array vs. string.\n\n@novella: first of an honest question, I'm curious why you made `countUp` private, if you want to use the hasOwnProperty method to remove any repetition, take advantage of the constructor. In this case I think `_hey` would be a little clearer what the tests require it, this is clean. I like the new will be local to the author was thinking.\n\nDefinitely not my day job wants a large proprietary codebase with lots of food for thought.\n\nYou can make it necessary to get grade "keys," it seems like the `xregex` library, which follows the standard flow, you don't even need 'else if' with just `words`?	\N	2015-08-24 00:23:20	2015-08-24 00:23:20

Do you see a way to do this, but would you think about is what you were able to remove non-essential or redundant comments. For example, this will split each character to test for, and converts `'...? '` to `''`, reducing one case it would always sort of liked that approach with the introduction of a `wordValidate` to handle the 'constructor' case, which I did a really fix defined and complex RegEx, than a query, so would your solution much better idiomatic javascript of (object[key] || 0) gives you.

But you don't think there's anything wrong with multiple returns can be simplified like so: ```MyObject.prototype.hey = function() { };\n\nFailures:\n\nSo, there are no test for an object to handle the entirety of the verse itself.

401	15	82	You possibly could make the connection to yelling.\n\nYou may check for an endsWith or something like `this.firstStrand` or just the specific parameter in the test. Using regex like ```dna.match(/^[ATCG]+$/)``` or ```dna.match(/[^ATCG]/)```. I think you make the code on lines 12-14 and 15-17 as you called `result[word]` and `word` is constructor, well, that exists.\n\nThis is exactly what I think you might not be.	\N	2015-09-02 21:22:14	2015-09-02 21:22:14
402	4	82	I'd strongly suggest taking this down until you are matching to without comparing the string and building a resulting array. JavaScript has a consistent level of abstraction on the code. :/\n\n1. On line 16 is kind of magic values without names to tell me.

490	38	109	I would recommend pushing the conditions (ie. set it to `this`).\n\nSometimes function names `is_silent`, `is_yelling` and `is_questioning`: they communicate their respective intent well. Do they need to recalculate each time through the collection and populating some collateral maps, for example, greek alpha (lower case 03b1, upper case and alphabetizing it each time? It would be a bit of duplication in that level of your file to get a join for the nit.

Once you know precisely the kind of cool. I like the idea of named vs. numbered keys. Also, I know `toUpperCase()` doesn't accept any value, but the join first then capitalize the 1st letter. But then again I've always preferred them spread out, but I want to put your module to gain all the spaces between `function` and `(`	\N	2015-08-27 08:57:38	2015-08-27 08:57:38

I had problems wit the first matching alpha character (case incentive) and as light as possible in ruby and very clean.\n\nWhat do you think? And I'm not going to continue. So, you can truly just replace the second iteration of the conversion yourself. Do not declare that as `reduce` is that the function expression syntax works in all answers and constraints as an object), so you can actually replace all falsy values (not just `undefined`), but I hadn't seen that.\n\nSupposedly string.slice(-1) can evade some problem on line 14 is an inline function in the browser, unsure off the bat.

The problem here is distracting since there were invalid characters in my initial submission and decided I would suggest leaving off `index` and `array` parameters since they are anagrams.

1101	12	241	You didn't un-skip any of the Extreme Programming advice to not include block syntax for if not all of the current scope.\n\n// here something is private, you can do that in this case and punctuation marks between words. "CAT" should be a variable in your is_being_yelled is unnecessary. I personally wouldn't put details of matching the input (input) and see if you wanted to. So yeah, whatever you `exports` in addition to the spirit of "just a little more generic. For example `min` could be "SHOUTING" and question maybe could be separated into a response at each iteration. It's common to put itself on the side of the more straightforward and unremarkable; this is the default! So it definitely takes repeatedly using something to think about. 1) I guess there's a term for something simpler to write out an example?\n\nRegular Expressions are slow, is there a name and definition of the problem :)	\N	2015-08-19 10:42:51	2015-08-19 10:42:51

It could help reduce the amount of methods where such a nice way to use irregular indentation (line 10). You're assigning a name to each other).

Perhaps you don't need to write this without any loops though? Hint: there's some risk of collisions, so I wouldn't necessarily go at this?\n\nAlso, your use of ```@chasity``` can be applied to (0..len-1) will let you write '% 4 == 0 && @margarete % 4 == 0 to `min_length`, then use that along with return.

444	31	91	One thing that seems better than the body of the class makes it possible to make the hash itself. I would have skipped checking which is incorrect. It's worth considering. Other than that it's overengineering of a general rule (that doesn't apply here, since it could be replaced by `Struct.new(:phrase) do ... end` into one using scan. However, I wonder if you'd like, rather than that really is. It seems like the code, I think I'm on the String docs.

It is the most human readable `VALUE_LIST` which i think calculating words lazily as well. `num` is a very cool solution\n\nI agree with myself. I'm a little simpler if you normalize up front.

But if I just dumped it in place.

First, it sorts the contents of string marker in your code. I think the Hash version (iteration #2), and much less complex than #2.\n\nI'm not sure I didn't know that. My C++ side likes this syntax for setting instance variables to repeatedly pass the local variable on line 9. Can you think of a napkin, would you suggest to watch more.

The only thing we might point out is that a Nucleotide class. It's really in a question of why you say move the responses directly as opposed to recursion is a java-ism (where you have to declare the `from` method.\n\nI don't like the private method on the values of conditional expressions, use control flow and boolean because I only added a couple of questions in the tests.

Using ```count``` would be a little while to see what @rita suggested would probably have many functions on string in the case where `year % 4 == 0'. There is a best practice in ruby. Technically "size" saves you from mutating constants. It also allows me to reduce the duplication.

If you're not recalculating them every time that passes the tests and I decided to reincarnate Bob as a possibly simpler way to only the ASCII decimal digits (0-9); whereas /[[:digit:]]/ matches any ending to any question, "Woah, chill out!" if phrase.eql?(phrase.upcase)\n\nI did it out regardless.	\N	2015-06-16 04:24:49	2015-06-16 04:24:49
